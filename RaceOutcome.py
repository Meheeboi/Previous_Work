#Problem 2 - Race Outcome 
# Write a python program to determine the outcome of a race between 
# three runners. The program should prompt the user for the runners' 
# names and finishing times. The program then should determine and rank 
# the runners based on finishing times. The program should also display 
# each runner's name and rank. If two or more runners have the same 
# finishing time the program should display a "Tie between runners" 
# message.
